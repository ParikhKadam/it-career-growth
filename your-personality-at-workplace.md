That's the first lesson - ignore most discussions in office. You will find plenty of such "intellectuals" willing to argue on any topic, the question is how is that argument helpful to you and the society. They won't give solutions. They won't provide an alternative. All they will do is give you negative energy. IT (and corporate) is full of such people - learn to ignore them.

You need to be a jack of all trades. Be ready to do anything. Any technology, any domain. When I say "ready", I don't mean "accept". You will be forced to take any domain/technology at work (which is my next point), but you should be quick to evaluate what is good for your future.

Learn to fight. If you don't want to work on something or your ideas are not accepted, don't work. Escalate to the highest of levels - no one will ever fire you. Your managers may hate you for bypassing them, but they cannot do anything more. Maybe your next hike will be 4% and not 6%. Doesn't count in early stages of career.

Never under-estimate business. Most people portray themselves as just coders (who will avoid talking) or a presentation guy (who will avoid coding). Learn to bridge the gap. You have to be an efficient communicator between these two groups - coders should respect you more than the guys who just blabber. Business teams should feel comfortable talking to you because you don't talk of weird coding problems and efficient algorithm to them.

Understand your client. Talk as much as possible with different people from the client team. Noone in your team would want you to be exposed to the client, but let them hate you. But ensure you talk to understand their business better. Discuss innovative ideas (you should follow trending groups for the domain you are in) and optimization strategies (you can easily find modules to optimize in the load of legacy code most of the IT companies carry)

Be quick and dirty. Noone wants a perfect solution initially. And that's your chance to make an impression. Just make it work. Once that's done, start "owning" the solution and enhance. If you are a good coder, you might not feel happy doing this, but then you will have to continue working under some jerk who presents a stupid prototype before your perfect code.

Always give emphasis on communication. In other words, if you are equally weak in both communication and technology - work on communication first.

Be self-motivated. In a place where everyone is whining, you cannot depend on others to set career goals for you. Most of the senior people have experience limited to similar IT companies and they don't know of a better world and culture. So they will compel you to believe that there is no good outside, and you have to be in the same shit forever. Spend more and more time in learning new skills. Don't depend on group studies (if you are used to those from college).
